This is the Rock/Paper/Scissors exercise from HyperSkill. It goes on to add larger games, such as Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Spock. (Though, this version for HyperSkill's exercise doesn't play by that game's rules! The show uses an order that makes the dialog snappier. The order should be different, but "Spock" at the end is a better joke.) To understand which choices beat the others, imagine the (odd number of) possible choices arrange on a circle. You make your pick and rotate the circle so that your coice is on top. Draw a line straight down. The choices that beat you are on one side. The ones you beat are on the other. (Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Spock doesn't follow this pattern.)

This game also records player scores to a file, rating.txt. (You must use this name in the parent directory for the exercise.) New users are added with zero points. "!rating" shows a user's running score. "!exit" leaves the game and saves the scores to the file.
